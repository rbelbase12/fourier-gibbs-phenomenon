# Fourier Series Animation: Gibbs Phenomenon Visualization

A Python project demonstrating how Fourier series approximate a square wave, including the Gibbs phenomenon (overshoot near discontinuities).

## 🎥 Demo

## 📖 Background  
The square wave function (odd periodic extension) is defined as:
![Equation](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/7d/ql_48c0f5cfa0558e7b74872db966f8197d_l3.png)

The Fourier series of a square wave is given by:
![Equation](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/ab/ql_f2723aee1f3cceca8e7e71fcfd984cab_l3.png)

Despite increasing \( N \), the approximation exhibits **Gibbs phenomenon**—persistent overshoots (~9%) near jumps.

## 🛠️ Setup  
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rbelbase12/fourier-gibbs-phenomenon.git
